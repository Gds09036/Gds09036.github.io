                <ul>
                    <li>The goal was to implement a GUI application in Java using JavaFX 17 that displays a gallery of images based on the results of a search query to the iTunes Search API.</li>
                    <li>This project required you to lookup things in Javadoc and apply your knowledge of concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces.</li>
                    <li>An application in which you were able to see different media loaded from the itunes library.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This project implemented and tested a class that represented the popular board game Connect Four. Connect Four is a two-player connection game involving a two-dimensional grid of tokens.</li>
                    <li>Using java, multiple classes were implemented as well as test cases to make sure the game worked as intended</li>
                    <li>To win the game, a player must strategically drop their tokens so that four of them connect inside the grid -- they are allowed to connect horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The game is over once all positions in the grid a filled or when a player wins the game.</li>
